Question 0: What does the command 'cd ~' do on the command line?
Goes back a directory

Question 1: What does the command 'ls' do on the command line?
Lists what is in your current directory

Question 2: What are the symbols '#' used for in bash and python?
Used for comments

Question 3: What is a python package? Are you familiar with any python packages?
I have used python packages before but I can't remember what ones off of the top of my head. From my understanding they are basically code with functions that you can use. I want to say that there is a math function where you can simply imput parameters for a sqaure root or a more complex equation and it will return it fo install/call the package

Question 4: What is a SNP? (hint: this is a biology question, not a computer science question)
A SNP is a short nucleotide polymorphism. This is typically when one nucleotide is wrong and can cause problems

Question 5: What is high-throughput (next generation) sequencing? What types of high-throughput sequencing have you heard of? How do they work?
I am pretty sure I know examples of this, but I am going blank at the moment. 

Question 6: What is read mapping?
From what I understand it is where you have a bunch of reads(strands of dna/genome) and you are trying to find the whole strand. The reads are typically smaller and you can use certain programs to help you map them where you can see overlaps.

Question 7: What is variant calling?
I know it, but don't really know how to describe it

Question 8: What are your post-graduation plans (if you have any- it's okay if you don't!)
PhD programs. I am waiting to hear back from Penn State and Stanford. I will be doing an internship at Stanford this summer though

Question 9: What have you enjoyed learning about in CS/bioinformatics courses?
Everything! I have literally have really enjoyed all of my courses. I love learning from various professors and different topics. I do know that I am not a huge phylogenetic person, but I can do it. 

Question 10: Is there anything in particular you want to learn before you graduate?
Anything and everything. Honestly looking at the syllabus I feel pretty happy about what we are going to be doing. 

Question 11: On a scale of 0-9, how comfortable are you using the command line?
5

Question 12: On a scale of 0-9, how comfortable are you coding in bash?
3

Question 13: On a scale of 0-9, how comfortable are you coding in python?
8

Question 14: In computer science, what is a variable?
Used to store data

Question 15: In computer science, what is a function?
Code that can be used again and again

Question 16: What is a for loop? What is a while loop?
A for loop runs until the set range while while loops only run when parameters are met.

Question 17: What is parallelization? Is running commands in-parallel more efficient than running them in a loop?
I'm not sure if I know the definition of parallelization. But running things in-parallel versus in a loop is more efficient
